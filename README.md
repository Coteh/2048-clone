A clone of [2048](https://play2048.co/), and also a remake of my first 2048 clone, [2048Clone](https://github.com/Coteh/2048Clone).

## Setup

### Browser

[Click here to play on the browser](https://coteh.github.io/2048-clone)

## Features

- Base game

## Development

Clone this repository, then run the following:

```
npm install
```

At this point, you can run a local web server on the project directory, and the game should render when navigating to the port of the server from your browser.

## Testing

Run the following to launch unit tests:

```
npm run test
```

Cypress tests can be accessed by running the following:

```
npm run cypress open
```

This will launch the tests in the Cypress UI. 

Alternatively, you can run the tests directly on CLI:

```
npm run cypress run
```
